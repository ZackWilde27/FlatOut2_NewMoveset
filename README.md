Press ```Ctrl``` twice to do a special boost, trading 1/3 of your nitro to tripple your speed instantly

Press ```W``` to jump, the longer you hold it, the higher you'll go

Holding ```S``` will cancel out gravity

Pressing ```A``` or ```D``` will strafe left and right, you can use it as an attack or to dodge obstacles

The WASD arrangement can be remapped in the settings

## Building
I used Visual Studio on Windows, it requires my fork of Sewer's FlatOut 2 SDK
